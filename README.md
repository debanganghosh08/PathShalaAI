## 🎯 The Problem

Students and young professionals in India face a bewildering array of career choices, compounded by generic guidance that fails to account for their unique interests and the rapidly evolving job market. This leaves many feeling unprepared and lost. PathShala AI was built to solve this.

We address the **Personalized Career and Skills Advisor** challenge by creating a dynamic, insightful, and deeply personal tool that empowers users to make informed decisions about their future.

## ✨ The Core Innovation: Hyper-Personalization at Scale

While other platforms offer generic courses or one-off mentorship, PathShala AI's core innovation is its **generative, end-to-end career architect**.

Our solution doesn't just suggest; it *builds*. For every user, our fine-tuned AI model generates a completely unique, multi-step learning roadmap, transforming a vague ambition into an actionable plan. This moves beyond static, one-size-fits-all advice and provides a dynamic, scalable solution to personalized career guidance.

## 🤖 Google Cloud AI Integration

This project was built to fully embrace the hackathon's encouragement to leverage Google's cutting-edge AI technology. Our core intelligence is powered by the Google Cloud ecosystem.

* **Fine-Tuned Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite:** We use a fine-tuned version of the Gemini model as our core engine. It's specifically trained to understand career trajectories and skill dependencies, allowing it to generate highly structured, context-aware roadmaps in a specific JSON format.
* **Google AI Studio & Vertex AI:** The model was fine-tuned and managed using Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI providing the scalable infrastructure to serve our model's predictions reliably.
* **Seamless Integration:** The AI is not a bolt-on feature; it's woven into the user's entire journey, from the initial job suggestions to the final, detailed learning path, creating a truly intelligent and responsive experience.
